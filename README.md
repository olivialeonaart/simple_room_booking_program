Simple Room Booking Program Project:
------------------------------------
This program application takes user input through text-based prompts to help user "book" a hotel room with various assets and upgrades and then repeats the entire booking details back to user.
------------------------------------
How it's Made:
Tech Used: Java

- imported a scanner
- organized our variables for the booking menu
    - occupancy choice
    - bed configuration
    - room layout options
    - special/additional features
 
- asked for user input for the 4 aforementioned options one by one, with every new set of options also having an "EXIT Program" Option
- repeated user's collection of choices back to them and ask for final confirmation,
    - upon confirmation, "Thank you for booking with our program, program will now terminate" END program.
    - upon negative confirmation, program will ask which options to change until user is satisfied and will confirm positive for end program.
 
- Lessons Learned:
    - getting better with user input and using the scanner tool
    - using conditional branches
    - creating branches within branches for more complex decision making
